PubSubServer
=============
#### Intro ####

This is a simple communication server.  The basic goal was to provide a real-time way to transmit information between
different parties and/or game clients.  This was born from the social aspect of shooting craps.  In craps it is the table
against the house, and it is that division that creates unity and comrodity among the players.  The hope is to capture 
a small portion of that.
